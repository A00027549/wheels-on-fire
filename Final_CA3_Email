Hi John,

I hope you're doing well!
I’m reaching out to let you know that we’ve completed the updates to your car website. We’ve worked hard to align it with the sleek, modern vibe you envisioned while also adding that personal touch of humor you wanted.

From the updated design elements to smoother navigation, we've fine-tuned the overall look and feel to match the style and personality of your brand. We’ve also incorporated humor in just the right places – lighthearted but still on-brand. Additionally, we’ve made sure to prioritize accessibility and ease of use, ensuring the site is not only visually appealing but also user-friendly for all visitors.

You can check out the updated website here: Wheels on Fire.(https://a00027549.github.io/wheels-on-fire/)
Feel free to take a look and let us know what you think! If there's anything else you'd like to adjust or tweak, we’re more than happy to make further improvements. We want it to be absolutely perfect for you.
Looking forward to hearing your feedback!

Best regards,
Dev Team
