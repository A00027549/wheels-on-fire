Hey team! Thanks for the excellent work you’ve put into the project so far. While it looks great, could we ensure the site’s accessibility is up to par? I heard Lighthouse might be a useful tool for this, although I’m not entirely sure how it operates. Also, I think the site would benefit from an additional page – maybe one that showcases our upcoming events or special offers. Lastly, I’ve noticed that when viewing the site on my mobile phone, the layout seems a bit off. Could you adjust it to make sure it’s fully responsive? I appreciate your hard work and can’t wait to see the updates!
