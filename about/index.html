                    Hi, I'm John—a lifelong car enthusiast. Ever since I was a kid, I've been captivated by how cars are engineered, from the roar of the engine to the elegance of the design. What started as childhood curiosity has grown into a passion, and this site is my way of sharing that journey. Here, you'll find the cars I've collected, restored, and raced, each with its own story and place in my heart.

                    Over the years, I've been fortunate to own cars that span decades and styles—from timeless classics to modern performance icons:
                    1967 Ford Mustang Fastback - Fully restored with original parts and a custom engine, a perfect blend of power and nostalgia.
                    2020 Porsche 911 Turbo S - Modern engineering at its finest, delivering unmatched performance and style.
                    1988 Audi Quattro - A rally legend, lovingly preserved and one of my earliest deep-dive restorations.

                Restoring a car isn't just repair—it's bringing history back to life. Many of my cars arrived in rough shape, but with patience and care, they've been reborn. On this site, I share before-and-after photos, the techniques I used, and the challenges I faced along the way.                </p>

                    For me, it's not just about owning beautiful cars—it's also about driving them. Over the years, I've participated in a variety of racing events, from classic car rallies to high-speed track days. There's nothing like the rush of pushing a machine to its limits, feeling the hum of the engine as you navigate sharp corners, and hearing the roar of the crowd as you cross the finish line.
                    On this page, you'll find details on some of my favorite racing experiences, including race results, behind-the-scenes looks at my prep work, and tips for anyone interested in getting into motorsports.
